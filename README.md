**Portfolio Website & Visualizations Assignment
**
For this project, I made a personal portfolio website to show my work, skills, and some interactive SVG visualizations I built with JavaScript. The website has sections like About Me, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact info, and it also includes a page with my visualizations.

**Features**

Portfolio Sections: 
About Me, Education, Skills, Projects, Contact (email, LinkedIn, GitHub)

Interactive Visualizations:
(1) Weekly Hours Bar Chart: Shows how much time I spend on activities in a week. I made sure the bars scale correctly and the labels donâ€™t get cut off.

(2) Bubble Animation: Multiple circles of different sizes move across the screen with start/stop buttons. Each circle moves independently and wraps around when it reaches the edge.
